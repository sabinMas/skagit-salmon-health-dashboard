Skagit River Chinook Salmon Population Health Dashboard
Overview
This interactive web-based dashboard visualizes the health and status of Chinook salmon populations in the Skagit River watershed of Washington State. The project combines geospatial analysis, historical population data, and environmental monitoring to tell the story of salmon recovery challenges and opportunities in the Pacific Northwest.

Purpose
Chinook salmon in the Skagit River are ESA-listed (threatened), with populations declining significantly over the past 30+ years. This dashboard aims to:
Visualize population trends - Show historical spawning run counts and identify concerning patterns
Map critical habitat - Display spawning and rearing habitat zones relative to current conditions
Identify barriers - Locate fish passage obstacles (dams, culverts) that block salmon access to habitat
Highlight restoration opportunities - Show where conservation projects can have the greatest impact
Communicate environmental context - Connect salmon decline to measurable threats (warming water, habitat loss, dam impacts, ocean conditions)
The dashboard is designed for both educational purposes and practical conservation planning—demonstrating how data visualization can support salmon recovery decision-making.
