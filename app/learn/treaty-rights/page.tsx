            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              In the mid-1850s, the United States government negotiated a series of treaties with
              the Native Nations of the Pacific Northwest. At councils in Medicine Creek (1854),
              Point Elliott, Point No Point, and Neah Bay (all 1855), tribal leaders ceded millions
              of acres of land to the United States. In return, they reserved specific rights —
              including the right to fish at their <strong>usual and accustomed grounds and
              stations</strong>.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              For the tribes, these were not concessions — they were explicit protections for a way
              of life built around salmon over thousands of years. The treaty language, negotiated
              partly in Chinook Jargon with U.S. government interpreters, stated that tribes would
              have the right to fish &quot;in common with all citizens of the Territory.&quot; Tribal leaders
              understood this to guarantee their fishing rights in perpetuity.
            </p>

              <p className="text-sm text-gray-800">
                <strong>Key fact:</strong> The Medicine Creek Treaty of 1854 was signed by
                Governor Isaac Stevens on behalf of the U.S. and leaders of the Nisqually,
                Puyallup, Squaxin Island, and other tribes. Similar treaties followed across
                what is now Washington State.

              A Century of Broken Promises
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Despite the treaty guarantees, the state of Washington spent much of the late 19th
              and early 20th centuries restricting and criminalizing tribal fishing. State fish and
              wildlife officers arrested tribal fishers for practicing rights their ancestors had
              explicitly reserved. Courts sometimes sided with tribes, sometimes with the state —
              with no consistent interpretation of what &quot;in common with&quot; actually meant.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              By the 1960s, tribal frustration had reached a breaking point. Inspired by the civil
              rights movement, tribes on the Nisqually, Puyallup, and other rivers began staging
              <strong> fish-ins</strong> — deliberately fishing in defiance of state regulations to
              assert their treaty rights. Leaders like <strong>Billy Frank Jr.</strong> of the
              Nisqually Tribe were repeatedly arrested. Their arrests drew national attention and
              eventually forced the issue into federal court.

                as chairman of the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission and received the

              United States v. Washington (1974) — The Boldt Decision
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              In 1970, the United States government — acting on behalf of the tribes — filed suit
              against the State of Washington in federal district court. Four years of proceedings
              followed. On February 12, 1974, Judge George Boldt issued his ruling in{' '}
              <em>United States v. Washington</em>.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Judge Boldt&apos;s decision was sweeping. He ruled that the treaties did guarantee
              tribes the right to fish at their usual and accustomed grounds, and that &quot;in common
              with&quot; meant a <strong>50/50 split</strong> of the harvestable salmon between tribal
              and non-tribal fishers. He also ruled that tribes had the right to participate in
              managing the fisheries that the treaties protected — establishing tribes as
              <strong> co-managers</strong>, not just users.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The State of Washington appealed immediately and vigorously. State fish and wildlife
              officers openly defied the ruling. The conflict went to the Ninth Circuit Court of
              Appeals and ultimately to the U.S. Supreme Court, which upheld Judge Boldt&apos;s
              decision in 1979.

              <p className="text-sm text-gray-800">
                <strong>Why it matters for salmon:</strong> By establishing tribes as co-managers,
                the Boldt Decision gave tribal nations legal standing to advocate not just for
                harvest rights, but for the habitat salmon need to survive. If the salmon runs
                collapse, the treaty rights mean nothing. Tribes thus have both the motive and
                the legal authority to push for habitat protection, dam removal, and climate
                adaptation — making them essential partners in recovery.

              The Living Agreement: Treaty Rights Today
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Treaty rights are not museum pieces. They are active, living legal protections that
              continue to shape policy today. In 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld — in an
              equally divided decision — a Ninth Circuit ruling that the State of Washington must
              repair thousands of culverts under state roads that block salmon migration. The{' '}
              <em>Washington v. United States</em> (Culverts Case) decision is a direct extension
              of the treaty right to fish: if the state&apos;s own infrastructure blocks the salmon
              from reaching their spawning grounds, the treaty right is violated.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The case has resulted in a multi-billion-dollar commitment to replace fish-blocking
              culverts across Washington State — one of the largest salmon habitat restoration
              efforts in the region&apos;s history, driven entirely by treaty law.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              The data you see on this dashboard — salmon return numbers, stream temperatures,
              habitat quality — exists partly because tribal co-managers pushed for the monitoring
              infrastructure to track it. The legal framework and the ecological science are
              inseparable.

            <li>
              Pacific Northwest tribes signed treaties in the 1850s preserving the right to fish
              at their usual and accustomed grounds — in exchange for ceding millions of acres
            </li>
            <li>
              For over a century, Washington State ignored and actively violated these treaty
              rights; tribes resisted through fish-ins and the courts
            </li>
            <li>
              The 1974 Boldt Decision affirmed tribal treaty fishing rights and established tribes
              as co-managers of salmon populations — entitled to 50% of harvestable fish
            </li>
            <li>
              Today, tribal nations and WDFW jointly set harvest limits, manage hatcheries,
              conduct spawner surveys, and advocate for habitat protection
            </li>
            <li>
              The 2018 Culverts Case shows treaty rights are still shaping policy — and still
