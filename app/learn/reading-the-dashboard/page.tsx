                  <strong>Salmonid Population Indicators (SPI) database</strong>, which tracks escapement

                  means the number of adult fish that escape the fishery and make it back to spawn.
                  Data is collected annually by WDFW biologists and tribal monitors using a combination

                  The U.S. Geological Survey operates hundreds of stream gauges across Puget Sound

              <li>
                <strong>Start with the map.</strong> Select a watershed you care about — either by clicking
                the map polygon or using the dropdown selector.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Look at the trend, not just the latest year.</strong> The 10–20 year trend line
                tells you far more than a single data point.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Compare watersheds.</strong> Switch between basins to see which systems are
                healthier and why — look for patterns in geography, land use, and stewardship activity.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Check the data sources.</strong> Every chart on the dashboard shows its source
                and data vintage. The expandable &quot;Data Sources&quot; section at the bottom of the
                dashboard page lists all sources and caveats.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Connect data to action.</strong> For each watershed, the basin detail page links
                to stewardship projects operating in that basin. Numbers only make sense in the context
                of what is being done about them.
