              This dashboard is built in partnership with the Native Nations of Puget Sound, who
              are the original stewards of these waters and salmon populations.

            <p>
              <strong>Content governance:</strong> Each tribal nation controls the content on
              their page. They decide what to share, how to share it, and can modify or remove
              content at any time.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Data sovereignty:</strong> Tribal nations retain ownership of their
              traditional knowledge and data. Not all knowledge is meant to be public, and we
              respect that.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Co-management:</strong> Tribal nations and state agencies co-manage salmon
              populations under treaty rights affirmed by the Boldt Decision (1974).
