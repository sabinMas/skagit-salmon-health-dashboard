---

## M1: Dashboard MVP ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] M1.1 — Build `<SalmonMetricCard>` component
- [x] M1.2 — Build `<IndicatorChart>` component (Recharts area/line, accessible data table)

## M2: Nations Template System — REMOVED

All `/nations` pages, `components/nations/`, and `lib/data/tribes.ts` deleted.
No real tribal partnerships exist — removing fabricated content was the correct call.
Stewardship projects page (`/stewardship`) covers restoration initiatives instead.

---

## M3: Learn & Education Hub ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] M3.1 — Build `<LearningModuleCard>` component
- [-] M3.2 — `<AudienceToggle>` (deferred)

- [-] M3.4 — `<EducatorResources>` (inline; abstraction deferred)
- [x] M3.5 — Assemble Learn index page (`/learn`)
- [x] M3.6 — Module: "Salmon Life Cycle" (`/learn/salmon-life-cycle`)
- [x] M3.7 — Module: "Treaty Rights & Co-Management" (`/learn/treaty-rights`)

## M5: Data Integration (Real APIs) ✅ COMPLETE

> Architecture: build-time seed JSON — `npm run data:refresh` → `lib/data/real/salmon-returns.json`
> No PostgreSQL needed. DB deferred to M6.

- [-] M5.1 — PostgreSQL + Prisma (deferred to M6)
- [x] M5.2a — Explore WDFW API schema, document field mapping (`docs/wdfw-schema.md`)
- [x] M5.2b — Write `scripts/fetch-wdfw.mjs` seed script (391 real records, 9 watersheds)
- [x] M5.2c — Update `getSalmonReturns()` to read real JSON; exports `salmonDataFetchedAt`
- [x] M5.3a — Fix USGS `/api/usgs` 400 error; 49 stations return real temps
- [x] M5.3b — Add current-temperature widget to dashboard
- [x] M5.4 — Verify GeoJSON name matching; added `geoJsonName` field to 3 watersheds
- [x] M5.5 — Remove mock data labels; update source attributions
- [x] M5.6 — Add data freshness indicators ("Refreshed Feb 21, 2026") to dashboard

---

## M6: CMS & Partner Editing Workflow 🗓️ NEEDS REPLAN

> Original scope (tribal partner CMS) is obsolete — nations pages removed.
> New direction TBD: possibly a lightweight admin interface for stewardship project content.

- [ ] M6.1 — Define new scope (what content needs editing without code?)
- [ ] M6.2 — Evaluate and select headless CMS or admin approach
- [ ] M6.3 — Implement chosen solution
- [ ] M6.4 — Update Next.js to fetch from CMS
- [ ] M6.5 — Create content editor guide

---

## M7: Polish, Accessibility Audit, Launch 🚧 ~80% COMPLETE

> **Goal:** Site is production-ready with verified accessibility, performance, and content.

- [x] **M7.1 — Full accessibility audit** ✅
  - WCAG 2.1 AA fixes: emoji aria-hidden, heading levels, table scope, aria-pressed on toggles,
    focus rings, InfoTooltip aria-describedby, IndicatorChart data table, aria-live for chart updates,
    descriptive aria-labels on ambiguous links
- [x] **M7.2 — Performance optimization** ✅
  - Eliminated build-time ISR cache failures (were 11–20MB Socrata responses)
  - `/api/wdfw` now serves pre-seeded 107KB local JSON
  - `/api/scrape` uses Socrata `/resource/` endpoint with SoQL filters (under 2MB)
  - GeoJSON cache headers (immutable, 1yr), gzip compression, `poweredByHeader: false`
  - Leaflet CSS scoped to dashboard layout only (saves ~30KB on all other pages)
  - Font: `display: swap` + `adjustFontFallback` to reduce CLS
- [x] **M7.3 — Responsive design review** ✅
  - Hamburger tap target 44×44px, map height responsive, hero heading scales,
    basin page flex-wrap, about table padding, chart axis font
- [x] **M7.4 — Content review** ✅
  - Removed all stale tribal-partnership claims site-wide
- [x] **M7.5 — SEO setup** ✅
  - metadataBase, title template, OG/Twitter tags on all pages
  - dashboard/layout.tsx wrapper for 'use client' dashboard metadata
- [ ] **M7.6 — Deployment**
- [ ] **M7.7 — Documentation**

## Current Sprint Status (Updated: Feb 22, 2026)

### Just Completed This Session

- ✅ Removed all Nations/tribal pages (fabricated partnerships)
- ✅ M5 Data Integration fully complete
- ✅ M7.1 Accessibility audit (WCAG 2.1 AA fixes across 9 files)
- ✅ M7.2 Performance optimization (API cache failures eliminated, Leaflet CSS scoped)
- ✅ M7.3 Responsive design review
- ✅ M7.4 Content review
- ✅ M7.5 SEO (metadata, OG, Twitter on all pages)

### Next Priorities

1. **M7.6 — Deployment** (Vercel or similar; `npm run build` is clean and ready)
2. **M7.7 — Documentation** (README update, data refresh instructions)
3. **M6 replan** — decide what CMS/admin scope makes sense now that Nations are removed

### Blockers

None. Build is clean. Site is deployable.
